This final project aims to compute and compare the surface energy of Au (110) 1 by 1 ideal surface and Au (110) 1 by 2 missing row reconstruction surface. 
The final_project.py code is used for calculating the surface energies using the EAM method.
The final_project_Quantum_Espresso.py is used for calculating the surface energies using DFT.
